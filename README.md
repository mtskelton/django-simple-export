# Django Simple Export / Import

A simple module for exporting / importing data from a Django installation.  Capable of handling large datasets and able to work with Mongoengine.

This module is still very much a work in progress and extremely rough around the edges, it's something I put together as I needed to quickly migrate some of the data from an existing Django installation which used Mongoengine.
I intend to add to it as an when needed, but feel free to contribute bug reports, fixes and improvements if you find the project useful.
